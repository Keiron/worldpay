#WorldPay
**A PHP 5.3+ wrapper for the [WorldPay](http://worldpay.com) payment gateway**

WorldPay is an easy to use payment gateway that is widely recognised and trusted. However, just about everything about the service is out of date. One of the most frustrating things about using WorldPay is the woeful lack of good documentation or official libraries. The result of this is, WorldPay's documentation is fragmented or incomplete and code examples are completely inadequate.

WorldPay also seems to make everything a lot more complicated than it needs to be.

I decided to make this package to abstract a lot of these complications away and instead provide a clear and easy to use API for creating WorldPay requests and listening for responses. This package will also be well unit tested and available through PHP Composer as a framework agnostic package.

**Note** If you are looking to integrate many payment gateways into your application, and you aren't going to be using all of WorldPay's features (e.g FuturePay or custom parameters) you should probably use [Omnipay](https://github.com/adrianmacneil/omnipay) instead.
